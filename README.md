## Prerequisites

### Python 3.7 Installation

We'll start by setting up Python 3.7, which is the version we'll be using for this internship.

1. Download Python 3.7 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Run the Windows x86-64 executable installer.
3. During installation, make sure to:
   - Add Python 3.7 to your system PATH by ticking the corresponding option.
   - Select "Install launcher for all users" and "Add Python 3.7 to PATH".
4. Complete the installation process, and ensure that Python 3.7 is installed by opening a command prompt (Win+R, type `cmd`, press Enter) and running:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

### Setting up the Environment

To ensure the correct environment configuration, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt and execute the following command to set the PATH:
   ```
   set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Python3
   ```
2. Edit your system variables by adding `C:\Program Files\Python3` to the `PATH` variable.
3. Verify the Python version again by running:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

## Getting Started

### Verifying Python Installation

Make sure Python 3.7 is installed by running the following command in the command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

### Installing Libraries

Install the required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly) using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

After installation, close the command prompt.

### Verifying Library Installation

To verify that the libraries are installed correctly, open the Python IDLE for Python 3.7.0 and run the following commands:

```python
import pip
import numpy
import pandas
import matplotlib
import seaborn
import plotly
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore and analyze data by using the libraries you've just installed. Perform data analysis, visualization, and gain insights from your datasets.
